# Term-Project
Cities across California have come up with a plan to help the homeless population by providing effective solutions to the issue of homelessness. For example, the City of San Jose has decided that they would spend 17 million dollars to build tiny homes for the homeless. As of right now San Jose has built enough homes to house 120 people a year. The goal of this tiny home project is to offer temporary housing to homeless people for three to four months, with the hope that they will find permanent housing after that given time. There is a lot of money being invested into this project which is why the city wants to track its progress and success, this is where the developers come in. As the developers we should design a database that keeps track of every aspect of the project so that many cities can use the efficient database to track progress. A majority of this data will be accessible to the city but sensitive data should be private. We will be given information that we needed to keep track of and from there we came up with certain classes that would efficiently hold all the information.
