# Contributions to the JPA Project - Team 9

Our main form of communication was through call and we worked on the project together all the time. There was rarely a time
where we did not work together. We felt we were most efficient when we could bounce off of each others ideas.
I cannot express how well we worked together. Every person has worked on all aspects of the project, we all worked together to fix the UML
plus the documentation, create the Java classes,the model building, the interactable program and the java documentation, and to look for resources
to code our project as reflected to GitHub commits. In conclusion we all did equal work so everyone contributed equally to the project.
